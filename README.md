TheRailwayProject is a program that uses OpenStreetMap data to visualise railway tracks and stations.
Additionally, the program is able to pathfind from one station/track to one or more station(s)/track(s).
The final route will then be displayed on the map and can be opened in a webbrowser or can be exported as a gpx file.
Data can be loaded in by specifying the coordinates of a bounding box or by selecting a country from the dropdown menu.
